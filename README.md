# LogicComparator
A simple simulator of circuit that compares two given numbers

# Introduction
This is a simulator that acts exactly like the comparator circuits in your ALU.

It gets two numbers, converts them to binary format, and send them to comparator.

# Test Bench
For testing the program, I created a shell script which will execute this file and compare the inputs with outputs results
and tells us if something is wrong or the program didn't give us the expected results.
